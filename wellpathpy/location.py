    Adds the surface location coordinates to the northing and easting arrays.

    This method does not check that surface location units are consistent

    Parameters
    ----------
    tvd : float
        true verical depth
    northing : float
        north-offset from zero reference point

        east-offset from zero reference point

    -----
    `northing` and `easting` units should be the same as the input deviation or results will be wrong
