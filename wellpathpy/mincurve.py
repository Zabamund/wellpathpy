    """Minimum curvature

    Calculate TVD, northing, easting, and dogleg, using the minimum curvature
    method.

    This is the inner workhorse of the minimum_curvature, and only implement the
    pure mathematics. As a user, you should probably use the minimum_curvature
    function.

    This function considers md unitless, and assumes inc and azi are in
    radians.

    Parameters
    ----------
    md : array_like of float
        measured depth
    inc : array_like of float
        inclination in radians
    azi : array_like of float
        azimuth in radians

    Returns
    -------
    tvd : array_like of float
        true vertical depth
    northing : array_like of float
    easting : array_like of float
    dogleg : array_like of float

    -----
    This function does not insert surface location

    Calculate TVD using minimum curvature method.

    This method uses angles from upper and lower end of survey interval to
    calculate a curve that passes through both survey points. This curve is
    smoothed by use of the ratio factor defined by the tortuosity or dogleg
    of the wellpath.

    Formula
    -------
    dls = arccos(cos(inc_lower - inc_upper) - sin(inc_upper) * sin(inc_lower) * (1 - cos(azi_lower - azi_upper)))
    rf = 2 / dls * (tan(dls/2))

    tvd = sum((md_lower - md_upper) * (cos(inc_lower) + cos(inc_upper) / 2) * cf)

    dls: dog leg severity (degrees)
    rf: ratio factor (radians)
    md_upper: upper survey station depth MD
    md_lower: lower survey station depth MD
    inc_upper: upper survey station inclination in degrees
    inc_lower: lower survey station inclination in degrees
    azi_upper: upper survey station azimuth in degrees
    azi_lower: lower survey station azimuth in degrees

    Parameters
    ----------
    md: float, measured depth in m or ft
    inc: float, well deviation in degrees
    azi: float, well azimuth in degrees
    course_length: float, dogleg normalisation value,

    Returns
    -------
    Deviation converted to TVD, easting, northing
        tvd in m,
        northing in m,
        easting in m
    Dogleg severity
        dls: dogleg severity angle in degrees per normalisation value
            (normalisation value is deg/100ft, deg/30m or deg/<course_length>)

    Notes
    -----
    course_length is set to 30 by default, assuming that md units are in meters.
    The user must change course_length if md units are feet.
    Typical values are:
    m: course_length = 30
    ft: course_length = 100

    Other values can be passed, but they are non-standard and therefore not
    explicitely supported.
