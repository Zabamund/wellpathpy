        The implementation is based on this [1] stackexchange answer by tma,

            In order to get a better picture you should look at the problem in
            2d. Your arc from (x1,y1,z1) to (x2,y2,z2) lives in a 2d plane,
            also in the same pane the tangents (a1,i1) and (a2, i2). The 2d
            plane is given by the vector (x1,y1,y3) to (x2,y2,z2) and vector
            converted from polar to Cartesian of (a1, i1). In case their
            co-linear is just a straight line and your done. Given the angle
            between the (x1,y1,z2) and (a1, i1) be alpha, then the angle
            between (x2,y2,z2) and (a2, i2) is –alpha. Use the normal vector of
            the 2d plane and rotate normalized vector (x1,y1,z1) to (x2,y2,z2)
            by alpha (maybe –alpha) and converter back to polar coordinates,
            which gives you (a2,i2). If d is the distance from (x1,y1,z1) to
            (x2,y2,z2) then MD = d* alpha /sin(alpha).

        In essence, the well path (in cartesian coordinates) is evaluated in
        segments from top to bottom, and for every segment the inclination and
        azimuth "downwards" are reconstructed. The reconstructed inc and azi is
        used as "entry angle" of the well bore into the next segment. This uses
        some assumptions deriving from knowing that the position log was
        calculated with the min-curve method, since a straight
        cartesian-to-spherical conversion could be very sensitive [2].
