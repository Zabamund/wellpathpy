## Introduction

`wellpathpy` is a LGPL-3.0 licensed library to import well deviations in (md, inc, azi) format, calculate their TVD values using a choice of methods and return them as positional logs in (tvd, northing, easting) format.

## Features

- load well deviation in (md, inc, azi) format:
    * meta data (header, rkb, dfe, rt)
    * md, incl, azi
- calculate position log survey using one of these methods:
    * minimum curvature method
    * radius of curvature method
    * tangential methods
- calculate dog-leg severity from minimum curvature
- calculate depth references using header data if available: MD, TVD, TVDSS
- return interpolated deviation in (tvd, northing, easting) format
- move surface location to (0, 0, 0) or to (kb, mE, mN)
- convert to tvdss based on kb elevation
- resample deviation on regular steps with minimum curvature only
