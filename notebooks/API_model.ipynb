    "## Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "`wellpathpy` depends on [numpy](numpy.org), [pandas](pandas.pydata.org) and [pint](github.com/hgrecco/pint).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import wellpathpy as wp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading a deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways of loading a deviation for use in `wellpathpy`, from a csv or within Python from a `pd.DataFrame` or a `np.ndarray`:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Loading a deviation from `*.csv`\n",
    "A valid input file must be a `*.csv` file containing the columns: ('md', 'inc', 'azi') in that order, as shown in this example:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "md,inc,azi\n",
    "0,0,244\n",
    "10,11,220\n",
    "50,43,254\n",
    "150,78.5,254\n",
    "252.5,90,359.9\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- column headers are **required**\n",
    "- `md` must increase monotonically\n",
    "- as `inc` and `azi` cannot be distinguished numerically it is the user's responsibility to ensure the data are passed in in this order\n",
    "- `inc` must be in range 0-180 (to allow for horizontal wells to climb)\n",
    "- `azi` must be in range 0-360\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then load them into `wellpathpy` using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "md, inc, azi = wp.read_csv(fname)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:  \n",
    "The `wp.read_csv` function reads a deviation survey from a CSV file. The columns must be named `md`, `inc`, `azi`, and `md` must be strictly increasing. Some simple sanity checks are performed to reject bad CSVs. read_csv supports all options `pd.read_csv` supports. Only those columns named 'md', 'inc', 'azi' will be read.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Loading a deviation from a `pd.DataFrame` or a `np.ndarray`\n",
    "In order to use `wellpathpy`, you will need three `np.ndarray` objects: `md`, `inc` and `azi`.\n",
    "If you create these with pandas or NumPy you can still use `wellpathpy` as long as they fit the following criteria:\n",
    "- `md`, `inc` and `azi` have the same `.shape` attribute\n",
    "- `md` increases monotonically\n",
    "- `inc` is in range 0-180\n",
    "- `azi` is in range 0-360\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the well header\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the well header information in a \\*.json file with this format and keys:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"datum\": \"kb\",\n",
    "\"elevation_units\": \"m\",\n",
    "\"elevation\": 100.0,\n",
    "\"surface_coordinates_units\": \"m\",\n",
    "\"surface_easting\": 1000.0,\n",
    "\"surface_northing\": 2000.0\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we can load it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "header = wp.read_header_json(fname)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting units\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, no unit conversions are run by `wellpathpy`, you therefore have the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import your deviations and headers in consistent SI units where:\n",
    "    - `md`: meters\n",
    "    - `inc`: degrees\n",
    "    - `azi`: degrees\n",
    "    - `elevation`: meters above mean sea level\n",
    "    - `surface_easting`: meters east of reference point\n",
    "    - `surface_northing`: meters north of reference point\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import deviations and headers in other units (e.g. feet) and convert to SI units:\n",
    "    - `md`: feet\n",
    "    - `inc`: degrees\n",
    "    - `azi`: degrees\n",
    "    - `elevation`: feet above mean sea level\n",
    "    - `surface_easting`: feet east of reference point\n",
    "    - `surface_northing`: feet north of reference point\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Important Notes:**  \n",
    "- The units for [`elevation`, `surface_northing`, `surface_easting`] must be the same as the `md` units before any `md->tvd` calculations are run, otherwise you will get inconsistent results.\n",
    "- `inc` and `azi` must always be passed as `degrees`, otherwise erroneous results will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conversion API\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to convert `md`, `elevation`, `surface_easting` or `surface_northing` from 'ft' to 'm' where `elevation_units` and `surface_coordinates_units` are in 'ft' for example, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "md               = wp.unit_convert(md, src='ft', dst='m')\n",
    "elevation        = wp.unit_convert(header['elevation'], src=header['elevation_units'], dst='m')\n",
    "surface_easting  = wp.unit_convert(header['surface_easting'],\n",
    "                                   src=header['surface_coordinates_units'],\n",
    "                                   dst='m')\n",
    "surface_northing = wp.unit_convert(header['surface_northing'],\n",
    "                                   src=header['surface_coordinates_units'], \n",
    "                                   dst='m')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We depend on [pint](github.com/hgrecco/pint) for the unit conversions. This means that you can add in your own units to the [unit registry](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/defining.html#programmatically) and then convert a quantity `data` from a unit [`ell`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ell) for example to `meters` with the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pint\n",
    "ureg             = pint.UnitRegistry()\n",
    "ureg.define('ell = 0.6275 * meter = ell')\n",
    "result           = wp.unit_convert(data, src='ell', dst='m', ureg=ureg)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting deviation surveys to positional logs\n",
    "\n",
    "`wellpathpy` provides the following methods to convert **deviation surveys** `md`, `inc`, `azi` into **positional logs** `tvd`, `northing`, `easting`:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended methods\n",
    "These methods are most commonly used in drilling operations and are recommended for most cases:  \n",
    "- `wp.mininum_curvature` **minimum curvature method**  \n",
    "    This method uses angles from upper and lower end of survey interval to\n",
    "    calculate a curve that passes through both survey points.  \n",
    "    This curve is\n",
    "    smoothed by use of the ratio factor defined by the tortuosity or dogleg\n",
    "    of the wellpath.\n",
    "    This method returns a dogleg severity calculated for a given course_length.\n",
    "- `wp.radius_curvature` **radius of curvature method**  \n",
    "    Calculate TVD using radius or curvature method.  \n",
    "    **Caution**: this will yield unreliable results when data are closely spaced\n",
    "    or when the borehole is straight but deviated.  \n",
    "    This method uses angles from upper and lower end of survey interval to\n",
    "    calculate a curve that passes through both survey points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backup methods\n",
    "These methods might be used for comparison to the recommended methods:  \n",
    "- `wp.average_tan` **average tan method**  \n",
    "    Calculate TVD using average tangential method.  \n",
    "    This method averages the inclination and azimuth at the top and\n",
    "    bottom of the survey interval before taking their sine and cosine,\n",
    "    this average angle is used to estimate tvd.\n",
    "- `wp.balanced_tan` **balanced tan method**\n",
    "    Calculate TVD using balanced tangential method.  \n",
    "    This method takes the sines and cosines of the inclination and azimuth\n",
    "    at the top and bottom of the survey interval before averaging them,\n",
    "    this average angle is used to estimate tvd.  \n",
    "    This will provide a smoother curve than the ave_tan method but requires\n",
    "    closely spaced survey stations to avoid errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not recommended methods\n",
    "These methods are provided for completeness and in case a comparison must be made to an existing survey using these methods, but they are *not recommended*:  \n",
    "- `wp.high_tan` **high tan method**  \n",
    "    Calculate TVD using high tangential method.  \n",
    "    This method takes the sines and cosines of the inclination and azimuth\n",
    "    at the bottom of the survey interval to estimate tvd.  \n",
    "    This method is **not recommended** as it can make gross tvd and offset\n",
    "    errors in typical deviated wells.\n",
    "- `wp.low_tan` **low tan method**  \n",
    "    Calculate TVD using low tangential method.  \n",
    "    This method takes the sines and cosines of the inclination and azimuth\n",
    "    at the top of the survey interval to estimate tvd.  \n",
    "    This method is **not recommended** as it can make gross tvd and offset\n",
    "    errors in typical deviated wells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "In order to use any of these functions, you can run the following code once you've imported your [deviation](#Loading-a-deviation) and [header](#Loading-the-well-header) and done any [unit conversion](#Converting-units) required as described above:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended usage:\n",
    "```\n",
    "tvd, northing, easting, dls = wp.mininum_curvature(md, inc, azi, course_length=30)\n",
    "tvd, northing, easting      = wp.radius_curvature(md, inc, azi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Backup usage:\n",
    "```\n",
    "tvd, northing, easting = wp.average_tan(md, inc, azi)\n",
    "tvd, northing, easting = wp.balanced_tan(md, inc, azi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Not recommended:\n",
    "```\n",
    "tvd, northing, easting = wp.high_tan(md, inc, azi)\n",
    "tvd, northing, easting = wp.low_tan(md, inc, azi)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpolate a deviation survey or positional log\n",
    "As deviation surveys are often not sampled at regular intervals, `wellpathpy` allows you to interpolate either a deviation survey or a positional log onto a given `md_step` or `tvd_step`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpolation of a deviation survey:\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_md, new_inc, new_azi           = interpolate_deviation(md, inc, azi, md_step=1)\n",

    "- Interpolation of a positional log:\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_tvd, new_easting, new_northing = interpolate_position(tvd, easting, northing, tvd_step=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes:**  \n",
    "- `wp.interpolate_deviation()` should not be used before `md` ->` tvd` conversion. Rather, convert your deviation survey to a positional log first, and then interpolate them onto a new `tvd_step` if needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `wp.interpolate_position()` requires that the tvd values must be strictly increasing, i.e. this\n",
    "method will **not work** on horizontal wells, use `wp.interpolate_deviation()` for those wells.  \n",
    "In order to interpolate only a section of a positional log, you can slice into it and pass a monotonically increasing tvd section only.\n",
    "\n",
    "- input arrays must not contain NaN values.  \n",
